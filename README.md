## About the content

When I was trying to do the [Flutter Clean App](https://github.com/TulioPintoNeto/Flutter-Clean-Architecture), a demand appeared from my work to have a already made project be reusable. We were finishing a big project in one of our clients and a new project was intended to be construct from "zero". We'll, the main problem is that this new project will be using some parts of the first one.

So, my original idea is to build a package that is reusable, and, of course, two new projects to use this package, to see how things are going to be done.
